# Mintlify CSS

This project is very simply the mintlify starter kit but with a custom **styles.css** added to it. The idea behind this demonstration is taht you can tweak the colors, borders, radii and more in styles.css pretty simply without having to locate each one manually yourself.

The original difficulty lay in ensuring that each radix button or div would change when a color was added. This no longer remains the case by simply looking for the selector and tweaking slightly with the variables defined at the top which will subsequenrly change the rest of borders in your documentation for your project.

The default styling is Mintlify's - to change that ensure you toggle the 1 and proceed to add your differences to make your documentation truly yours. Much appreciation goes to the Mintlify team and hope this makes someone's life a little easier!
