# Mintlify root/style.css

This project is very simply the mintlify starter kit but with a custom **style.css** added to it. The idea behind this demonstration is that you can tweak the colors, borders, radii and more in **style.css** pretty simply without having to locate each one manually yourself.

The original problem lay in ensuring that each radix button or div would change when a color was added - I had problems finding one that did this accurately. This no longer remains the case as it can be simply done by looking for the selector and tweaking slightly with the variables defined at the top which will subsequently align the rest of borders in your documentation for your project.

The default styling is Mintlify's - to change that ensure you toggle the (1) via the variable name, *--ot-hard-reset:* and proceed to add your differences to make your documentation truly yours. Much appreciation goes to the Mintlify team and hope this makes someone's life a little easier, just copy and paste into your project and give a star if you want to remember this for another project!
